# Webmead

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

This is learning based project to help me attempt more complex front-end skills using Angular, CSS and JavaScript.

# Development server
- Because this is a learning project I do not have it running on a live or demo server. If you wish to see if it works you can copy the code into your editor. 
- I used Angular so I just used the `ng serve` or `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Which will take you to `http://localhost:4200/` if you're using Angular. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
